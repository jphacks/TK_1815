# Debug

Set environment variable DEBUG to "bot-express:\*" to activate full debugging.
In production environment, setting "bot-express:skill-status" is recommended. To make this debugging work properly when you use redis as memory store, you need to enable Redis Keyspace Notification like following to subscribe expired event.

```
$ redis-cli config set notify-keyspace-events Ex
```

# Limitation

Webhook supports following event at present.

**LINE**

- message
- follow
- unfollow
- join
- leave
- postback
- beacon

**Facebook**

- messages
- messaging-postbacks

If you deploy cluster of bot-express based application, you need to use redis as context store. Please refer to the [document](https://nkjm.github.io/bot-express/module-bot-express.html) for detail.
